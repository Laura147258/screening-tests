Hello,

this is a simple test to assert your coding abilities. Nothing tricky here just pure coding. 
You'll be asserted on the quality, simplicity of your code. Comments and proper indentation are required.


## Task

Build a Ionic mobile app that uses the following template :
https://www.behance.net/gallery/51349815/Krystal-Clear-Mobile-app


- Build the 3 pages : A login page, a list of items page and a details page.
- Link the list and the details page with an informations from this api endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos Use ngResource (Ionic1) or ngx-resource (Ionic2).
- Commit your code to **gitlab.com** and give us the link to it.


## Notes : 
- You can use Ionic1 or 2, but Ionic 2 is preferred...
- Colors, fonts are on the page, use them.
- Sass only, no pure css code.
- Non working code will automatically result in failure of the test
- **I HATE code duplication...**
