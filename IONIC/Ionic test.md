Hello,

this is a simple test to assert your coding abilities. Nothing tricky here just pure coding. 
You'll be asserted on the quality, simplicity of your code. Comments and proper indentation are required.


## Task

Build a Ionic mobile app that uses the following template :
https://www.behance.net/gallery/51349815/Krystal-Clear-Mobile-app


- Build the 2 pages : A login page and a list of items page.
- The facebook connexion must work (create a facebook app for it)
- Link the list and the details page with information from this api endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos Use ngx-resource (Ionic2).
- Commit your code to **github.com** and give us the link to it.
- Give us an APK to test it.


## Notes : 
- Use Ionic2.
- For the card representing the shoes, use a custom component and bind the data using **@input** and **ngModel**
- Colors codes and fonts are on the page. Use them.
- For the icons use the native ionic icons
- Sass only, no pure css code.
- Non working code will automatically result in failure of the test
- **I HATE code duplication...**
